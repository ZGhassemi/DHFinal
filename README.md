# Introduction 

I chose ten novels from three different period of ~100 years. I started with Gothic literature from the late 1700’s to 1899. I then chose ten works ranging from the late 1600s right up to 1799ish (carefully not choosing duplicates). Then I used ten works from 1480-1750, trying to mostly focus on before 1700. I used the Norton World and English Literature sets to pick out my sources. 
The limitations I see with this dataset is of course that I can’t use every piece of literature. Hence, I stuck with the most influential and well known works. 
 
 My motivation for this project came from playing around with Voyant and discovering that the word "time" was used a lot of times in Gothic literature from 1890-1899. So, I decided to set out and explore this deeper. The questions I asked were is this a theme that became popular during the Vicotrian period as a whole, or just the final decade? How does the Victorian usage of the word "time" compare to 18th century usage? And finally, was time a concept in peoples' minds pre-industrialization?
